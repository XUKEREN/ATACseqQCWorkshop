A number of algorithms have been developed in parallel that allow identification of binding sites from ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip datasets and subsequent visualization in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser as custom annotation tracks. However, summarizing these tracks can be a daunting task, particularly if there are a large number of binding sites or the binding sites are distributed widely across the genome.},

  abstract      = {Mapping DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) within nuclear chromatin is a traditional and powerful method of identifying genetic regulatory elements. DHSs have been mapped by capturing the ends of long DNase I-cut fragments (>100,000 bp), or 100-1200 bp DNase I-double cleavage fragments (also called double-hit fragments). But next generation sequencing requires a DNA library containing DNA fragments of 100-500 bp. Therefore, we used short DNA fragments released by DNase I digestion to generate DNA libraries for next generation sequencing. The short segments are 100-300 bp and can be directly cloned and used for high-throughput sequencing. We identified 83,897 DHSs in 2,343,479 tags across the human genome. Our results indicate that the DHSs identified by this DHS assay are consistent with those identified by longer fragments in previous studies. We also found: (1) the distribution of DHSs in promoter and other gene regions of similarly expressed genes differs among different chromosomes; (2) silenced genes had a more open chromatin structure than previously thought; (3) DHSs in 3'untranslated regions (3'UTRs) are negatively correlated with level of gene expression.},

Regulatory DNA thus coincides with open or accessible genomic sites of remodeled chromatin. Current chromatin accessibility assays are used to separate the genome by enzymatic or chemical means and isolate either the accessible or protected locations. The isolated DNA is then quantified using a next-generation sequencing platform. Wide application of these assays has recently focused on the identification of the instrumental epigenetic changes responsible for differential gene expression, cell proliferation, functional diversification and disease development. Here we discuss the limitations and advantages of current genome-wide chromatin accessibility assays with especial attention on experimental precautions and sequence data analysis.

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: ATAC-seq (Assays for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) is a recently developed technique for genome-wide analysis of chromatin accessibility. Compared to earlier methods for assaying chromatin accessibility, ATAC-seq is faster and easier to perform, does not require cross-linking, has higher signal to noise ratio, and can be performed on small cell numbers. However, to ensure a successful ATAC-seq experiment, step-by-step quality assurance processes, including both wet lab quality control and in silico quality assessment, are essential. While several tools have been developed or adopted for assessing read quality, identifying nucleosome occupancy and accessible regions from ATAC-seq data, none of the tools provide a comprehensive set of functionalities for preprocessing and quality assessment of aligned ATAC-seq datasets. RESULTS: We have developed a Bioconductor package, ATACseqQC, for easily generating various diagnostic plots to help researchers quickly assess the quality of their ATAC-seq data. In addition, this package contains functions to preprocess aligned ATAC-seq data for subsequent peak calling. Here we demonstrate the utilities of our package using 25 publicly available ATAC-seq datasets from four studies. We also provide guidelines on what the diagnostic plots should look like for an ideal ATAC-seq dataset. CONCLUSIONS: This software package has been used successfully for preprocessing and assessing several in-house and public ATAC-seq datasets. Diagnostic plots generated by this package will facilitate the quality assessment of ATAC-seq data, and help researchers to evaluate their own ATAC-seq experiments as well as select high-quality ATAC-seq datasets from public repositories such as GEO to avoid generating hypotheses or drawing conclusions from low-quality ATAC-seq experiments.

  abstract      = {The IS50 elements, which are present as inverted repeats in the kanamycin-resistance transposon, Tn5, can move in unison carrying with them any interstitial DNA segment. In consequence, DNA molecules such as a λ :: Tn5 phage genome are composed of two overlapping transposons — the kan segment bracketed by IS50 elements (Tn5), and λ bracketed by IS50 elements. During direct transposition, mediated by IS50 “O” (outside) ends, the kan gene is moved and the λ vector is left behind. During inverse transposition, mediated by the “I” (inside) ends of the IS50 elements, the λ vector segment is moved and the kan gene is left behind. Direct transposition is several orders of magnitude more frequent than inverse transposition (Isberg and Syvanen, 1981; Sasakawa and Berg, 1982). We assessed the specificity and precision of the rare events mediated by pairs of I ends by mapping and sequencing independent inverse transpositions from a λ :: Tn5 phage into the amp and tet genes of plasmid pBR322. Using restriction analyses, 32 and 40 distinct sites of insertion were found among 46 and 72 independent inverse transpositions into the amp and tet genes, respectively. Eleven sites were used in two or more insertion events, and the two sites in tet used most frequently corresponded to major hotspots for the insertion of the Tn5 (by direct transposition). The sequences of 22 sites of inverse transposition (including each of the sites used more than once) were determined, in eleven cases by analyzing both pBR322-IS50 junctions, and in eleven others by sequencing one junction. The sequence of the “I” end of IS50 was preserved and 9-bp target sequence duplications were present in every case analyzed. GC pairs were found at each end of the target sequence duplication in ten of the eleven sites used more than once, and also in seven of the other eleven sites. Our data indicate that transposition mediated by pairs of “I” ends is similar in its specificity and precision to the more frequent transposition mediated by IS50 “O” ends.},

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10–20× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.Availability:http://maq.sourceforge.netContact:rd@sanger.ac.uk},

Multiple processor cores can be used simultaneously to achieve even greater alignment speeds. Bowtie is open source (http://bowtie.cbcb.umd.edu).},

The full-text minute index is often used to make alignment very fast and memory-efficient, but the approach is ill-suited to finding longer, gapped alignments. Bowtie 2 combines the strengths of the full-text minute index with the flexibility and speed of hardware-accelerated dynamic programming algorithms to achieve a combination of high speed, sensitivity and accuracy.},

  abstract      = {In cells, chromatin is folded into a 30 nm fibre. Recent genome-wide studies have shown that DNaseI-sensitive sites are present in both transcribed and non-transcribed genes and are enriched in the gene-dense regions of the human genome. The distribution of open chromatin has also been shown to correlate with gene density rather than transcription. In this review it is suggested that open chromatin corresponds to a 30 nm fibre interspersed with discontinuities, and that blocks of open chromatin might facilitate gene transcription, but are neither necessary nor sufficient. The nature of these discontinuities is not known but could correspond to alterations in chromatin fibre structure caused by irregular nucleosome positioning, nucleosome remodelling activities, variant histones or the binding of specific transcription factors.},

Whilst numerous tools exist to quantify QC metrics, there is no common approach to flexibly integrate these across tools and large sample sets. Assessing analysis results across an entire project can be time consuming and error prone; batch effects and outlier samples can easily be missed in the early stages of analysis.Results: We present MultiQC, a tool to create a single report visualising output from multiple tools across many samples, enabling global trends and biases to be quickly identified. MultiQC can plot data from many common bioinformatics tools and is built to allow easy extension and customization.Availability and implementation: MultiQC is available with an GNU GPLv3 license on GitHub, the Python Package Index and Bioconda.

We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. RESULTS: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Trimmomatic is licensed under GPL V3.
