# Workshop Description
In this workshop, we will provide a valuable introduction to the current best practices for ATAC-seq assays, high quality data generation and computational analysis workflow. Then, we will walk the participants through the analysis of an ATAC-seq data set. Single cell ATAC-seq data analysis will be briefly covered at the end by comparing to the bulk ATAC-seq data analysis. Detailed tutorials including R scripts will be provided for reproducibility and follow-up exploration.

**Expectation:** After this workshop, participants should be able to apply the learned skills to analyzing their own ATAC-seq data, provide constructive feedback to experimenters who expect to generate high-quality ATAC-seq data, and identify ATAC-seq data of reliable quality for further analysis.

# Pre-requisites
Participants are expected to have basic knowledge as follows:
-   Basic knowledge of R syntax
-   Basic knowledge of simple UNIX commands, such as grep, and awk
-   Some familiarity with the GenomicRanges, BSgenome, GenomicAlignments classes
-   Familiarity with the SAM file format ([https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf))

Basic understanding on how ATAC-seq data are generated is helpful but not required. Please refer to the following reference for detailed information about the ATAC-seq technology.

Please refer to the following resource to preprocess the ATAC-seq data prior to performing quality assessment using the ATACseqQC package.

# Workshop Participation
Participants are expected to have basic knowledge about R and several R packages as described above in advance. To follow along the hands-on session, we recommend participants bring your own laptop. We will post a Docker image with required packages and data pre-installed for you to download and run the analysis within a Docker container. If you will use the Docker image, please get Docker installed ([https://www.docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started)) in advance. For participants who wish to install all packages by themselves, you will also need to install the following computing tools.
 - R (version >3.5.0; [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)) 
 - RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
 - The ATACseqQC package along its dependencies
 - Integrated Genome Browser (IGV, http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download)

For participants who wish to install all packages by themselves and use a Windows with OS lower than Win 10, which lacks a UNIX terminal, we recommend one of the following alternatives.
 - Install Cygwin ([https://www.cygwin.com/](https://www.cygwin.com/))
 - Install git Bash ([https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/))
 - Install UnxUtils   ([https://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/))
   
# R / Bioconductor packages used

# Workshop goals and objectives

## Learning goals

 - Understand how ATAC-seq data are generated
 - Learn how to perform comprehensive quality control of ATAC-seq data
 - Identify high quality ATAC-seq data for downstream analysis
 - Identify most likely reasons for ATAC-seq data failing QC
 - ATAC-seq data analysis workflow

## Learning objectives

 - Analyze a pre-aligned, excerpted ATAC-seq dataset from the original ATAC-seq publication (Buenrostro et al., 2015) to produce
   comprehensive insights into the quality of the data
 - Create a plot showing library fragment size distribution 
 - Create overview plots showing signal distribution around transcription start sites
 - Automatically generate IGV snapshots showing signal distribution along multiple housing keeping genes (positive control genes) 
 - Create a plot showing CTCF footprints
 - Evaluate the ATAC-seq data for mitochondrial DNA contamination, duplication rate, background noise level, library complexity and Tn5
   transposition optimality
